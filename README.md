# Single_perceptron

<h2> Project description </h2>

In this project, I developed a program which gets a students grade and informs that whether he or she has acquired average grades lesser that
14 or not. Lesser 14 means that he or she is failed for the whole semester.

<h3> How it is done? </h3>
To reach the goal, I used a single neuron and I trainded it with random grades from different students. Lerning rate is set to 0.001.
<h3> Technoligies which are used: </h2>
1- python 3.6 </br>
2- Concept of Perceptron
